**1. What is AI?**

Summary:

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the concept of creating machines that can process information and make decisions like humans. It involves coding and programming to replicate human intelligence.

Highlights:
- ðŸ¤– AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is also known as kecerdasan buatan in Indonesian.
- ðŸ§  AI processes information from various sources, such as images, videos, and audio, to make decisions.
- ðŸ’» AI is coded using programming languages and can replicate human intelligence.

Key Insights:

- ðŸ¤– AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a term often heard in todayâ€™s world. It refers to the creation of machines that can mimic human intelligence. This concept has become increasingly popular due to its potential to revolutionize various industries and improve efficiency.
- ðŸ§  The human brain serves as the center of intelligence, processing information from different senses to make decisions. Similarly, AI acts as an artificial brain that processes data from various sources, such as images, videos, and audio, to determine the next course of action.
- ðŸ’» AI is developed through coding and programming. It involves using programming languages to create algorithms and instructions that enable machines to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously. This coding aspect sets AI apart from other technologies.

**2. Machine that can learn?**

Summary:

AI can learn through machine learning, which is inspired by how humans learn. It includes supervised learning, where machines learn from examples and answers, and reinforcement learning, where machines learn through rewards and punishments.

Highlights:
- ðŸ¤– AI can learn through machine learning.
- ðŸ§’ Humans inspire the concept of machine learning.
- ðŸ“š Supervised learning involves learning from examples and answers.
- ðŸš² Reinforcement learning involves learning through rewards and punishments.

Key Insights:
- ðŸ¤– Machine learning is a crucial aspect of AI and allows machines to learn and improve their performance over time.
- ðŸ§’ The concept of machine learning is inspired by how humans learn, such as through question and answer sessions and trial and error.
- ðŸ“š Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where machines learn from labeled examples and corresponding answers. It helps machines recognize patterns and make accurate predictions.
- ðŸš² Reinforcement learning is another type of machine learning where machines learn through rewards and punishments. It enables machines to learn optimal behavior based on the outcomes of their actions.
- ðŸ¤– Another machine learning type:
  - Supervised
  - Reinforcement
  - Unsupervised
  - Transfer learning
  - Semi supervised
  - Self supervised
  - Few shot learning
  - Zero shot learning
  - etc
